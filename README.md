# wine-xdg-file-manager
Simple shell script to set up Wine to use xdg-open for directories

## How to use it

This script automatically creates (in the same directory it is placed in) a registry file and a shell script associated with it. It then registers the generated .reg file with Wine.

Just place *winefilemanagersetup.sh* in the folder where the script will be located, launch it and you're good !
